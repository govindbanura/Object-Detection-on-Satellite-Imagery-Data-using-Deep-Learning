# Object-Detection-on-Satellite-Imagery-Data-using-Deep-Learning
Efficient and accurate object detection has been an important topic in the advancement of computer vision systems. With the advent of deep learning techniques, the accuracy of object detection has increased drastically. The project aims to incorporate the Faster R-CNN technique for object detection using neural networks to achieve high accuracy with real-time performance. A major challenge in many of the object detection systems is the dependency on other computer vision techniques for helping the deep learning-based approach, which leads to slow and non-optimal performance. In this project, we use a completely deep learning-based approach to solve the problem of object detection in an end-to-end fashion. The network is trained on the DOTA dataset. We have used Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network method (Faster R-CNN) for detection. Each detection is reported with some form of pose information. This could be as simple as the location of the object, a location, and scale, or the extent of the object defined in terms of a bounding box. The resulting system is fast and accurate, thus aiding those applications which require object detection.
